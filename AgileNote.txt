                                                             ============================================== 
 AGILE
======
-> Agile is a iterative and increemental Approach.
-> Agile is an Iterative and Incremental Process.

Agile Principles
----------------
1) Customer no need to wait for long time.
2) We develop, test and release peice of software to the cusomer with few number of features.
3) We accept/accomodate requirement changes. 

-> There will be good communication between Customer, Business Analyst, Developers & Testers.

ADVANTAGES
----------
1) Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development or We can accommodate Requirement 
    changes in th middle of development.
2) REleases will be very fast (Weekly).
3) Customer no need to wait for long time.
4) Good communication between team.
5) It is very easy model to adopt.

DISADVANTAGE
------------
-> Less focus on design and documentation since we deliver software very faster.


SCRUM
=====
-> Scrum is a framework through we build a software by following Agile Principles.
-> Scrum includes a group of people called as Scrum team. Normally contains 5-9 members.

1) Product/Project Owner
2) Scrum Master
3) Dev Team/ ST devlopers(SDE)
4) QA Tester/ ST tester(SDET)


1) Product Owner: Define the features/functions of the product
                  Prioritize features according to market value
                  Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed
                  Accept or reject work results.

2) Scrum Master: The main role is facilitaing and driving the agile process.

3-4) Developers and QA: Develop and Test the software.

SCRUM Terminology
-----------------
1) User Story: User Story is nothing but a Feature/module in a software.
2) Epic: Epic is nothing but, It is a collection of user stories. 

Note: Product Owner will defines the features of the product in the form of user stories.

2) Product backlog: Product backlog Contains list of user stories(Requirements). Prepared by product owner.
3) Spirint/Iteration: Sprint is a period of times to complete user stories, decided by product owner and team, 
                      usually it takes 2-4 week of time.
4) Sprint Planning Meeting: Meeting conduct with the team to define what can be deliverd in the sprint and duration. (One day meetings)
                           1) How many stories we have in the backlogs.
                           2) How many stories we are going to develop and test.
                           3) What is the sprint duration.
5) Sprint backlog: List of commited stories by Dev&QA for specific sprint.
6) Scrum Meetings: Scrum Meeting is nothing but a meeting conducted by Scrum Master everyday 15 minutes. Scrum meeting is also called as
                   Scrum call/standup meetings.
                   1) What you do yesterday?
                   2) What will you do today?
                   3) Arethere any blockers in your task?
7) Sprint Retrospective meeting: It means conducts meeting after completion of every sprint. The enteire team, including both the Scrum
                                 Master and the product Owner should participate.
8) Story point: Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev & QA in the form of Fibonacci series.
                1 story point= 1 hour/1 day
                Login page---> Dev-5 and QA-3 hour= 8 Hours/1 Day

9) Burndown chart: Burndown chart is nothing but it shows how much work remining in the sprint. It Maintained by the scrum master daily.
